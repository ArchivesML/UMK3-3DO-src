# What is UMK3?
Ultimate Mortal Kombat is a arcade game released in 1995 by Midway, with a 3DO port planned to release. It was sadly canceled in 1996.

# Why was the port cancelled?
Wikipedia states it was due to the ridiculous amounts of delays which would make it release well over UMK3's peak of popularity.
Luckily, a user grabbed the source code and leaked it to places like AssemblerGames.
